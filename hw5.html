   All modern websites and web applications are built using three <i>fundamental</i> technologies: HTML, CSS and <br> JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.
<br>
<br>
   In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.

<h3>What is HTML?</h3>


HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and <br> describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
<br>
<br>
HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, <br> etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
<br>
<br>
In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
<ol>
    <li>The opening tag</li>
    <li>The closing tag</li>
    <li>The actual element</li>
</ol>

</p>
